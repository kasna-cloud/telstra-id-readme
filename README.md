# Telstra GCP Innovation Day 
 This repo contains participant information for the Telstra Innovation Day event.
 Use information in this repo to explore data and develop operational apps.

## Summary 
The Telstra GCP Innovation Day is an opportunity for Telstra staff to create and 
build and idea to solve business problems. The platform we will use is Google 
Cloud Platform which has foundations within Telstra.

There are two Streams of focus for the Innovation Day:

1. *Application Modernisation* - Kubernetes and container-based application 
modernisation. This will solve the time-to-market and cost problem of developing
and bringing solutions to customers.

2. *Data and ML Operations* - Batch, Stream data processing architectures which 
implement the latest technology in model development, (re)-training and serving. 
This stream focuses on bringing actionable insights and real-time Machine 
Learning to big and fast data.

## Team Resources

- Storage: `gs://telstra-id-PROJECT_ID-storage/`
- Git: `gcloud source repos clone  --project=telstra-id-PROJECT_ID`
- GKE creds: 
`gcloud container clusters get-credentials --project=telstra-id-PROJECT_ID --zone="australia-southeast1-a" "telstra-id-PROJECT_ID-gke"`

### Real-time Streaming

There are five data synthesizers which are streaming data for  available for use.
The synthesizers are each publishing into their own Pub/Sub topic. 
The messages can be retrieved from the associated Pub/Sub subscription.

These streams are available:
- [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](telstra-id-data-synth)

#### Call Data Record (CDR) Generator

There are two generators that run for CDRs. The Australian CDR generator will 
create call records to and from ten digit numbers from Australian area codes 
and mobiles. Published to PubSub topic `cdr_aust`. The International CDR 
generator will create call records from Country Code + Nine digits numbers, the 
CDR will always have and Australian (+61) number as either the call origin or 
destination. Published to PubSub topic `cdr_intl`.

#### Network and Server alarms

This synthesizer attempts to simulate alerts that are typically generated by 
datacenter servers and networking devices. Alerts are published to the topic 
`alarm_synth` and are available in the subscription `alarm_synth`.

#### Cell Tower Data Synth

This generator will simulate cell tower data in JSON format. Data is published
to a topic called `celltower_synth`, there is an associated subscription called
`celltower_synth`.

#### Customer Modem Generator

Customer modem health responses are simulated with the data schema below.

| Column name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| customer_ID | ID of the customer whose modem is online |
| timestamp  | Timestamp of when modem ping returns |
| suburb_state | Suburb and State for the address of the customers' premise |

#### Service Request Generator

Service requests for impacted services are simulated using the data schema below.

| Column name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| customer_ID | ID of the customer that is online |
| timestamp | Timestamp of when the customer submitted a service request about their internet service being down |

### Datasets

These datasets are available to teams and loaded either into your BigQuery instance,
or available in a storage bucket.

- Storage bucket: `gs://telstra-id-storage`
- Storage bucket: `https://source.cloud.google.com/telstra-id/shared-resources`

#### Cell Tower Data

OpenCelliD provides a huge cell tower dataset used for a multitude of 
commercial/private purposes by patrons worldwide. Use this dataset for locating 
devices or understanding network coverage patterns.  A worldwide cell tower 
database is available here:
- [OpenCellid](https://www.opencellid.org/)

#### Opensea NFT Assets Data - Art Block Factory

We will also be providing data from Opensea specifically from the 
“Art Blocks Factory” project and making it available in BigQuery. This will 
include details for the NFTs available as well as historical sales data.
For info regarding the project as well as the data schema see:
- https://opensea.io/collection/art-blocks-factory
- https://docs.opensea.io/reference/asset-object

| Column name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| token_id | The token ID of the ERC721 asset |
| image_url | An image for the item |
| background_color |  The background color to be displayed with the item |
| name | Name of the item |
| external_link | External link to the original website for the item |
| asset_contract | Dictionary of data on the contract itself (see asset contract section) |
| owner | Dictionary of data on the owner (see account section) |
| traits |  A list of traits associated with the item (see traits section) |
| last_sale |  When this item was last sold (null if there was no last sale) |

#### Public Datasets

In addition to the supplied data sets, Google also have a repository of samples
datasets which can be found here; https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data

The data itself is located here; https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=bigquery-public-data&page=project

The dataset of most interest are:
1. catalonian_mobile_coverage
2. catalonian_mobile_coverage_eu

There are additional datasets provided in a bucket called `telstra-id-datasets`
within the shared project.
